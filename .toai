# Additional instructions on how to work with this project.

Among the files you will find `.toai`. These files contain additional context/instructions on how to work with the project.
It uses Markdown syntax, using headings for your better understanding of context.
Instructions are surrounded by square brackets with `toai` preffix. For example: toai[you should run such instruction]. Everything not in square brackets should be considered just as context.
Meeting instruction, you should make necessary changes in the directory where the corresponding `.toai` file is located. Once instruction is processed - you should mark it completed by adding `done` before the instruction. If instruction is marked as `done` or `skip` - ignore such instructions. For example: skip[you should ignore this instruction] or done[you should ignore this instruction]
Ask before running any instruction. Running instructions, be sure to follow the code style and structure of the project.
