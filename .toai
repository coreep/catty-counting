# What is this project about

This project is an Accounting Assistance.

# Additional instructions on how to work with this project.

Each file named `.toai` contains additional context or instructions. It uses Markdown syntax, using headings for your better understanding of context. For each directory - read `.toai` located in that directory.
Instructions are defined only like `TODO: TOAI: you should run such instruction`
Execute every instruction. After it is executed - replace `TODO` with `DONE` to mark it completed. Example: `DONE: TOAI: this instruction should be skipped because it is executed`.
Ask before running any instruction.

# CodeStyle requirements

Write code in the same style as the code of the project. Before adding new files to a directory - check 3 files in that directory. If there are no such files - ask how should you proceed.

  * Use a consistent naming convention for packages and files.
  * Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

## We are following pattern "Command".

Main points:

  - A lot of logic paths can be described as chain of Commands.
  - Command is represented as an instance, that is capable to store state and dependencies for execution of a Command.
  - Command can use a Client to perform actions with external entities, like DataBases, APIs, File Management Systems, etc.
  - Client has an instance too, but its state is considered to be immutable after execution.
  - Commands receive parameters as a list of arguments during initialization.
  - Commands receive and store necessary clients as `deps` field on the instance.

## Logging

  * Use structured logging with slog.Logger.
  * Add contextual information to logs.
  * Use field name constants taken from logger/logger.go, add new if necessary.
  * Avoid logging sensitive information.
  * Pass logger as a dependency to commands/clients.

## How to handle errors

  * Use `fmt.Errorf` when propagating the error.
  * Write an error message in a story-telling fashion, like `fmt.Errorf("downloading file: %w", err)`.
  * When create an error or wrap error coming from an external source, add stacktrace with `errors.WithStack`.
